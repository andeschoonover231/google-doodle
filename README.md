# Legend of Zelda: 35th Anniversary Google Doodle

The Legend of Zelda will be turning 35 on February 21st, 2021. This series has been really special to countless people over the years, and I’m no exception. Since I was 10, I’ve been pretty much obsessed. I used to play the games while my brother watched and it was the main big way we bonded when I was 12 and he was 4. This connection through storytelling and spending time together really cemented in my head that this was something I really loved.

Throughout the last 35 years, there have been 19 games spanning 12 different consoles, the Legend of Zelda has been one of the most loved and celebrated video game series of all time.
